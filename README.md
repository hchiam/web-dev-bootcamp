Just one of the things I'm learning: https://github.com/hchiam/learning

## Node.js and Express.js demos:

Some setup I did (you don't have to do this to use this repo):
```js
npm init
npm install express --save # <- --save makes the install also save to package.json
```

To use the Node.js/Express.js demos:
```js
cd web-dev-bootcamp/random/node
npm install
node node-demo.js # or node express-demo.js
```

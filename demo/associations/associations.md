# Associations

I.e. having associated data by relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.

* Example of one-to-many: Facebook user with many photos.
* Example of many-to-many: students and courses. Each student can have multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

We'll use Mongoose to connect/associate data.

Two methods:

1) Embed data (to associate it)
2) Reference data (to associate it)

## Embed data (to associate it)

User
Post

## Reference data (to associate it)

# Yelp Camp

* landing page
* campgrounds page (name + image)
* header and footer partials
* bootstrap

## Steps

```bash
npm init
```

(Follow the prompts. I chose to name the main js file as app.js instead of index.js)

```bash
npm install express ejs --save # will install both express and ejs in one command
touch app.js
```

Then start the server:

```bash
node app.js
```

or

```bash
nodemon index.js # to auto-run upon saving app.js
```

Now create and edit files as needed.
